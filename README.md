Project description:

We have made NFT marketplace with Gitcoin Passport to provide defense of artists from bots.

Solved problems:
1. Byers-monopolists - usually artists want to distribute NFT-collection for a lot of people, not only couple ot them. But there are a lot of situation when one-three buyers completely bough out whole collection with help of bots.
2. Gas wars - when really popular collection has dropped, people want to overtake competitors and because of that decide to pay more for gas to be first who can validate transaction in network.
3. Preventing Sybil attack - similarly with first problem, but in that case NFT not just artwork but right for voting. 

When project was started: Around between 18 and 20 june. 

Problems during the project:

Our plans:
1. Focus not just on technical part but in UI and UX.
2. Making collaboration with artists
3. Development on-chain smartcontract for collecting validated (with help of Gitcoin Passport) ETH addresses. In our marketplace user have ability to subscribe for some collection and when drop will be provide users will receive notification about that OR maybe will recive NFT automatically. We still thinking about model.
